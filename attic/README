This attic is kind of a shelf where abandoned coding attempts get moved for
later reference or re-pickup.

Each conserved attempt is either a single file, a single patch of a folder
with patches inside, often including an explaining README.

Before getting here, most of these attempts were Git branches, so they can be
re-applied at any time. Patchsets were created with 'git format-patch
--keep-subject', so

  'git am -3 <patch1> [<patch2> ...]'

is the tool to re-apply them. For each attempt it's noted where the branch
was applied last time, so it's likely a good idea to re-apply that code to the
same commit again, to ensure a clean patch application and to allow seeing the
context back then.

These branches were removed from the Git repository at all to reduce the
clutter seen in listings of branches.

All files containing code are (tar'd and) gzipped to not clutter up recursive
'grep'ing in the main source folder.
