As far as I (Traumflug) can see, this was an attempt to ease PID tuning by
setting PID parameters according to a model easier understandable by humans.

This was moved to the attic because a) the developer is no longer responsive
and b) because automatic PID tuning is around the corner, so users (hopefully)
no longer have to mess with PID parameters at all before too long.

Even if automatic PID tuning turns out to be not fully satisfying,
functionality provided by this patchset should go into Configtool (which didn't
exist when it was written).

This branch was last applied to commit 592df2c73ffe19178f53a04cd384ca9f44cda599,
"Drop redundant "simulator.h" includes." of 2015-07-27 21:50:49.
