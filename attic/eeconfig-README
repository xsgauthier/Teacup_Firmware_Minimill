This branch was an attempt to add configuration strorage in the EEPROM.
Similar to Marlin, which allows to do virtually all configuration through
M-codes at runtime.

The obvious penalty is, some calculations can no longer be done at
compile time and have to be done at runtime. It also increases binary size.
These are the reasons why this branch sat unattended in the repository for a
long time without being moved to experimental/master. If tested at all,
the last tests were done in 2011.

With the advent of Configtool it becomes even more unlikely this kind of
configuration/calibration ever becomes standard. Whatever can be stored in
EEPROM, Configtool allows to set it at compile time, keeping the firmware
smaller and faster. The only small disadvantage of Configtool is, one has to
do 2 or 3 clicks to build and upload again.

This branch was last applied to commit d7789ee21721a061eb50ec5fd4d18ed73a6948e3.
