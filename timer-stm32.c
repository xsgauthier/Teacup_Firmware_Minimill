/** Timer initialisation.

  Initialise timer and enable system clock interrupt. Step interrupt is
  enabled later, when we start using it.

  For the system clock, we use SysTickTimer. This timer is made for exactly
  such purposes.

  Other than AVRs, Cortex-M doesn't allow reentry of interupts. To deal with
  this we use another interrupt, PendSV, with slightly lower priority and
  without an interrupt source. The possibly lengthy operation in dda_clock()
  goes into there and at the end of the SysTick interrupt we simply set PendSV
  pending. This way PendSV is executed right after SysTick or, if PendSV is
  already running, ignored.

/** Specify how long until the step timer should fire.

  \param delay Delay for the next step interrupt, in CPU ticks.

  \param check_short Tell whether to check for impossibly short requests. This
         should be set to 1 for calls from the step interrupt. Short requests
         then return 1 and do not schedule a timer interrupt. The calling code
         usually wants to handle this case.

         Calls from elsewhere should set it to 0. In this case a timer
         interrupt is always scheduled.

  \return A flag whether the requested time was too short to allow scheduling
          an interrupt. This is meaningful for ACCELERATION_TEMPORAL, where
          requested delays can be zero or even negative. In this case, the
          calling code should repeat the stepping code immediately and also
          assume the timer to not change his idea of when the last step
          happened.

  Strategy of this timer is to schedule timer interrupts not starting at the
  time of the call, but starting at the time of the previous timer interrupt
  fired. This ignores the processing time taken in the step interrupt so far,
  offering smooth and even step distribution. Flipside of this coin is,
  schedules issued at an arbitrary time can result in drastically wrong delays.
  See also discussion of parameter check_short and the return value.

  This enables the step interrupt, but also disables interrupts globally.
  So, if you use it from inside the step interrupt, make sure to do so
  as late as possible. If you use it from outside the step interrupt,
  do a sei() after it to make the interrupt actually fire.

  On ARM we have the comfort of hardware 32-bit timers, so we don't have to
  artifically extend the timer to this size. We use match register 1 of the
  first 32-bit timer, TIM5.
