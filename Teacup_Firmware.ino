  The existence of this file makes sources buildable with the Arduino IDE.

  While Teacup can be built and uploaded using Arduino IDE, please consider
  using Configtool for this task. Configtool not only allows printer
  configuration in a GUI, it also builds smaller and faster binaries. Build
  and upload functions can be found in the main menu there.
